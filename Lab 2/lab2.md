2) Licenses are important because they ensure that open source software remains free. They ensure that the software can be modified
   and distributed to anyone, in any form. However, they also allow the original creator of the software to place restrictions on the distribution.
   For example, a license could say that any changes to the source code must be given to the original creator at the time of distribution. 

3) Any software with no license is entirely the property of the original creator, the user has no explicit rights. Any modification or distribution 
   would then technically be a violation of copyright law.

4) I agree with the claim that Gopher failed due to no following an open source model. The early users at the time were all involved in the community, so
   so obviously theyo would be turned off by Gopher's lack of openness, and would enjoy the WWW's open nature. As stated, CERN quickly lost control of the WWW
   to the development community, and I think this has created an overall better Internet today.

5) I think Android uses the Apache 2.0 license because they value openness, and want their users to be free to use their sofware for whatever they like.
   Other licenses like GPL are more restrictive and would be harder to comply with for a piece of software that is distributed all over the world.

7) I think the GPL license would be best for a company.
