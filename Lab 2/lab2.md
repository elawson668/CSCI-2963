2) Licenses are important because they ensure that open source software remains free. They ensure that the software can be modified
   and distributed to anyone, in any form. However, they also allow the original creator of the software to place restrictions on the distribution.
   For example, a license could say that any changes to the source code must be given to the original creator at the time of distribution. 

3) Any software with no license is entirely the property of the original creator, the user has no explicit rights. Any modification or distribution 
   would then technically be a violation of copyright law.

4) I agree with the claim that Gopher failed due to no following an open source model. The early users at the time were all involved in the community, so
   so obviously theyo would be turned off by Gopher's lack of openness, and would enjoy the WWW's open nature. As stated, CERN quickly lost control of the WWW
   to the development community, and I think this has created an overall better Internet today.

5) I think Android uses the Apache 2.0 license because they value openness, and want their users to be free to use their sofware for whatever they like.
   Other licenses like GPL are more restrictive and would be harder to comply with for a piece of software that is distributed all over the world.

7) I think the GPL license would be best for a company. It requires derivatives to be released under the same license, and requires the source code to also 
   be released when the derivative is released. LGPL is probably better for developers, as it is similar to GPL, but derivative software is not required to also
   be released under LGPL. This would allow a developer more freedom when distributing their derivative, as they could pick a license that works the best for
   them. The Apache and BSD licenses are the best for the common good, as they are non-copyleft licenses and therefore are the most free and open of the bunch.
   They allow a user to modify the source code and keep all of the changes propietary.

9) For the project, I would like to choose a project that I think I can make a meaningful contribution to. Ideally, I can contribute to a project in a way that makes
   simpler and more intuitive to use. I dislike software that is neeelessly complicated, and I think that simplifying a program opens it up to more potential users.
   I don't neccessarily know who the users might be, but I would like to try to make their lives a little easier. I will probably choose the Apache or BSD or MIT license,
   as I value freedom and openness of software. I would like any software I write to have few restrictions on how other people can use and modify it.
