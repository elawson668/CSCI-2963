I found a broken link in the FreeBSD documentation pages to the PC-BSD Users Manaul. I updated the link to the correct one. 

Good documentation is important becuase it ensures that developers and users to use sofware correctly and efficiently, with as little frustration as possible.

This lab has taught me that there are bugs everywhere, and that while it will probably be impossible to fix them all, just fixing one can a make a big difference
for someone who may have been affected by the bug.
